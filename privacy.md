# Privacy Policy for azstorage

_Last updated: September 26, 2025_

azstorage is a personal photo and video synchronization app that allows you to upload and download media files directly to your own cloud storage account (Azure, AWS, or GCP).  

## Information Collection
- The app requests access to your **Photos and Videos** on your device in order to back them up to your chosen storage account.  
- No photos, videos, or personal data are ever sent to the developer.  
- All transfers occur directly between your iOS device and your configured cloud storage.  

## Storage Account Information
- You provide your own **storage account URL**, **container/bucket name**, and **authentication token (SAS token or equivalent)**.  
- This information is stored **locally on your device** and is never transmitted to the developer.  

## Data Usage
- We do not collect analytics, ads, or usage data.  
- Your files remain entirely under your control.  

## Your Choices
- You can revoke photo permissions anytime in iOS Settings.  
- You can delete the app to remove all locally stored data and settings.
