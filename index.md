# azstorage

**azstorage** is a simple iOS app that lets you back up and sync your photos and videos to your own cloud storage account (Azure Blob, AWS S3, or Google Cloud Storage).  

Unlike traditional cloud services, azstorage gives you full control:  
- ✅ Upload your photos and videos to your personal storage  
- ✅ Download from your storage back to your device  
- ✅ No third-party servers — all connections are between your iPhone and your cloud
